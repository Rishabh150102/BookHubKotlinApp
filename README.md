Book Hub

I have made this app in which a user can login and has a list of books.
1.	It has a navigation bar.
2.	A user does have to login every time he opens the app.
3.	User can add the books to his favorites section.
4.	It can also sort books according to the ratings of the book.
When the user clicks on the book it shows the book name and its description. The details of the book are fetched using API. It reads the book with Volley command.
Navigation drawer has Options Dashboard, Favorites, About and Profile Section.
